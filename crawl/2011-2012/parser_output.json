A key component of many successful Internet applications is a scalable, high-performance, and highly-available distributed system.  Moreover, as the planetary-scale services become prevalent and grow in importance, it becomes necessary to understand the distributed systems underpinnings that will enable the future applications. This is a distributed systems course with an experimental systems viewpoint: the course will discuss the architecture and teach the understanding of the performance of real systems. The title of the course reflects the blurring of boundaries between computer networks and distributed systems, as often distributed systems are used to implement large-scale services that could not be implemented and deployed solely at the network level. The syllabus for this research-oriented course is driven by published, current papers. After completing the course, the students should be able to engage in doctoral-level research in this field. Paper evaluations that demand critical reasoning will be a part of the grade. There will be a midterm and a final group project report, with a goal of publishing the best projects in top conferences (with additional work).<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

This course covers the fundamentals of multiprocessor computer architecture -- i.e., computer systems built from individual processing elements while balancing performance, cost, and programmability. The course qualitatively and quantitatively examines multiprocessor design trade-offs.

In particular we treat queuing systems, branching processes and Monte-Carlo methods. We then present hidden Markov models and random Markov fields.<br/>The rudiments of point processes are then considered.<br/>We follow closely the book of Guttorp.

Many enterprises or entrepreneurs risk failure because they design products rather than services. Even basic products need minimal services without which they cannot be sold (e.g. warranty, customer service).<br/><br/>In this course you will work in teams. You will choose an idea of IT service and analyze the business environnment of this service. You will then design a business model for your IT service. To do so, you will use traditional marketing methods as well as SEAM - an innovative method that provide a systemic model of a business.",

The number of leisure trips has increased, while the share of commuting trips has shrunk. At the same time, new forms of mobility have appeared, such as multiple residences, long-distance commuting, urban tourism and day-trips. These are accompanied by a significant rise in the number of kilometres travelled by car and by plane, which in turn generates considerable environmental problems. Mobility is an issue for urban transport design and territorial development. If we are to regulate mobility, we have to re-think our understanding of transport demand.<br/>",

We will also give a quantitative and qualitative overview of global urbanisation, and then explore the different dimensions of contemporary urbaneness. Urban planning will be addressed as a specific object, that is, as a relation it establishes between knowledge and action. <br/><br/>Finally, the city and urban issues, at stake in contemporary society, are approached. This analysis is enriched by the study of some metropolises, which are also \"global cities\".<br/><br/>This course will be especially oriented toward the notion of public space. This takes place in the scope of a CUS-supported co-operation programme called USUM (Urban Systems, Urban Models), involving, beyond Ch\u00f4ros/EPFL, the ETH Studio Basel and the Mendrisio Accademia (USI).

   "content": "On the basis of the knowledge acquired in the first year, the \"Construction\" angle divides the building into characteristic and recognisable elements in order to introduce the aspects of typology and detail, which will enable students to reconstitute the building as a structure and expressive whole.<br/><br/>In parallel, the \"Materials\" angle presents the complemetary tools required for the choice of appropriate projects.<br/><br/>The course thus favours the acquisition of a creative construction method as a component of a coherent architectural language.<br/><br/>It therefore teaches scientific and technical knowledge that will enable students to take acts of construction into account in a rational, hierarchised and concrete way, thus providing them with the resources necessary to introduce the factor of \"materialisation\" into architectural projects while being aware of whole gamut of their complexity.<br/><br/>At the same time, this specific knowledge is placed in an overall philosophy of architecture and within the framework of reflections on history and doctrine (construction culture), just as it would be in the course of the development of a project (construction project).<br/>",

This multidisciplinary knowledge calls for both historical research and detailed consideration of materials technology and construction practice as well as economic and environmental aspects.<br/><br/>Critical-historical research and material analysis, in terms of the specific constructional identity of C20 architecture, demand ad hoc preservation strategies, drawing on specific types of expertise .

If students look forward to this achievement, they might also worry about future tasks that exceed the specific skills they have acquired during their studies. The Direction of the EPFL has introduced the SHS Programme in order to train students to comply with these \u00ab human \u00bb dimensions of their professional activity.<br/><br/>This course aims at developing such skills by means of case-study decisions that students might face in their future practice : students are encouraged to integrate ethical reasoning into decisions concerning the \u00ab human \u00bb dimension of their professional activity.<br/>Students choose, in agreement with the teachers, an ethical case that will be the subjet of their research project. The subject of choice should deal with a contemporary ethical issue.<br/>The research work that will be undertaken during the course includes :<br/>1) the elaboration of the research question, from an ethical point of view ;<br/>2) the clarification of the \u00ab ethical \u00bb problem at stake, as well as the assessment of the \u00ab ethical \u00bb implications that will be discussed in the research project ;<br/>3) the development of an ethical discussion on the problem.<br/>In order to achieve their research, students will be asked to realize some intermediate tasks (e.g. readings reviews). The teachers will provide regular monitoring of students' work, including feedbacks and suggestions to facilitate the successful accomplishement of the research project.<br/>Since students are likely to work in teams in their future professional activity, working in groups is strongly recommended, although not mandatory.<br/>",

Then, it introduces the main fields, with vector/tensor calculus and operators. An important part of the course is dedicated to the definition of the strain and stress tensors. Conservation equations, state equations and boundary conditions are then specified.

Following a unified presentation of classical methods (finite element, finite volume, finite differences), the finite difference method is discussed in detail to illustrate the basic concepts. Through the study of simplified mono-dimensional, steady and unsteady problems, the discrete equations are analyzed in terms of accuracy and stability, which are essential for assessing the consistency of numerical solutions with respect to physical reality. These approaches are then extended to treat multi-dimensional problems. In order to solve the discrete equations, methods for solving (linear and nonlinear) systems of algebraic equations are presented with emphasis on their domain of application and computational complexity.<br/>The finite volume method and mesh generation techniques are subsequently presented to illustrate more applied concepts directly related to fluid mechanics.<br/>Laboratories based on the use of Matlab exercises illustrate the theoretical concepts and provide an understanding of the implementation and use of the algorithms presented. They also serve as the indispensable basis for undertaking the mini-project application.",

Three-dimensional solid and thin to moderately thick shell finite elements are then developed. The possible numerical problems (shear locking, hourglass modes, etc) are discussed and solutions for circumventing these difficulties are presented. In a second part, the course addresses numerically the free motion (modal analysis) of conservative structures modelled with a large number of degrees of freedom and the subspace iteration method, well adapted to this problem, is described and discussed. Finally, the forced motion (time response) of damped structures discretised with a large number of degrees of freedom is studied and the methods of Newmark, powerful for the time response by modal superposition, are presented.",

Yet, the self is an emotional self as well reacting upon its bodily signals and thoughts, frequently in interaction with its current and previous environment. We are thus not simply an individual self, but also a social self. The problematic and scientific study of these topics will be presented in the first part of the course, after having provided basic knowledge on scientific and empirical methods common to cognitive psychology, and thus essential to follow the content of the later course. <br/>At the same time, students will start to elaborate on study ideas and questions that will determine their research activates during the remaining course. In particular, individual research projects will be performed in groups of 2-3 students. The specific research questions will be developed and elaborated for research questions / topics provided for this course. After having decided on a hypothesis, students will develop their method, test participants (data collection), treat the data for statistical analysis, write a scientific report. <br/>",

The skills taught in this course are essential if you are interested to become a consultant, an IT project manager, or need to specify IT system requirements.<br/><br/>In this course, you will : (1) Manage a (simulated) manufacturing company. (2) Specify the required business service and define the role of IT in providing this service. (3) Implement a prototype of the IT service.<br/><br/>In this course, we teach the theory only <b>after</b> the practical experimentation. <b>Without your active participation in the experimentation there will be no learning!</b> This course mainly focuses on the business and IT strategies.

The purpose of this course is to explore new venture creation by adopting a process perspective - from opportunity recognition to establishing a successful new firm - and by studying the challenges of entrepreneurship from multiple perspectives, i.e. from various functional perspectives such as finance, managerial economics and marketing, as well as from the perspective of various key constituents involved in new venture creation (e.g., venture capitalists). In this course, a new venture is defined as an innovative start-up firm which has a high potential for growth and value generation.<br/>The course will offer a thorough theoretical understanding of new venture creation combined with practical techniques and methods for analyzing and evaluating business opportunities, crafting growth-oriented strategies and developing creative approaches to commercialization. The class will prepare students to work as key employees in new ventures, to pursue careers as autono\u00acmous entrepreneurs, careers as intrapreneurs and careers in the start-up community. <br/><br/><br/>The five main pedagogical objectives of this course are:<br/>\u2022  Understand the challenges of new venture creation in a comprehensive, integrative way<br/>\u2022  Experience the early stages of the entrepreneurial process by working on a business project proposal<br/>\u2022  Sharpen your ability to analyze and evaluate new venture opportunities<br/>\u2022  Be able to write and present a convincing business project proposal<br/>\u2022  Develop an \"entrepreneurial mindset\"<br/><br/>",

Such companies did not exist forty years ago and some of them are merely ten years old. Still, high growth remains somehow a mystery which could not be really replicated (with only a few exceptions) outside of Silicon Valley. Such an exceptional phenomenon will be studied not only through case studies but also through real live cases.<br/><br/>The high failure rate of start-up growth is an indication that even in Silicon Valley entrepreneurship remains a difficult process, not to say that it is nearly impossible to master. No theory has been able to predict the outcome of entrepreneurial ventures and it is not even clear that practice and experience really help in building successful start-ups. Therefore, the only way to better understand startup dynamics is to experience them in real cases. EFPL is surrounded by a higher than average high-tech start-ups, particularly at the Science Park (PSE) and close by Garage. <br/><br/>Students will be given an opportunity to work with entrepreneurs on challenges they face in the start-up growth. Given the limited timeframe, it will not be possible to have a complete overview of the challenges an entrepreneur faces, but the objective would be that the students learn as much as possible from such a situation. Because all start-ups are different however, a large part of the course will be to complement the real case with other case studies so that the students learn as much as possible.<br/>",

   "content": "Starting from the strong form associated to the problem of the longitudinal deformation in a uniform bar under traction and compression, the corresponding integral formulation and the weak form are first developed. The latter formulation is next discretised by means of the Galerkin method and the finite element method. Typical concepts like shape functions, classes of admissible functions, Hilbert and Sobolev spaces of functions or convergence criteria, necessary for the understanding of the approach, are briefly described, and the discrimination between natural and essential boundary conditions is discussed. The one-dimensional problem is then generalised by introducing various discontinuities (loading, section, material, etc) into the bar and the concept of higher-order finite elements is introduced. Following an approach similar to the one used for the one-dimensional problem, the course then focuses on the two-dimensional boundary-value problem of heat conduction on a surface. The corresponding weak formulation based on a scalar variable (temperature) is then approximated with two-dimensional finite elements. Lagrangian and serendipity, quadrangular and triangular, so-called master elements are developed and used for elaborating two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped finite elements (geometrically deformed finite elements). After a convergence study of the approximated solutions obtained with two-dimensional finite elements, an example of application is fully treated.",

Each module will be introduced by a historic and geopolitic overview to initiate and better understand the local realities. It will be followed by a lecture on specific cultural or artistic expressions of the region or country. Relevant and attractive, these cases studies (architecture, literature, music, movies, social networks, manga) will deepen a particular cultural focus, which in turn will inform understanding of the society as a whole. Finally, a personality from the field (head of a Swiss company, diplomat or scientist with extensive international cooperation) will close this module by sharing their expertise and experience on what it means to live and work abroad and give a practical perspective on other cultures. <br/><br/>Spring semester (\u00abGoing East 2\u00bb) consists of tutored projects sessions as agreed with supervisors.

Their importance in terms of worldwide exchange - goods, services, peoples, but also, crucially, ideas and technical innovation - is often overlooked. <br/>\u00abGoing East\u00bb focuses on civilizations and societies, both ancient and present, engaged in deep transformations. Lectures will provide knowledge and tools for a better understanding of the cultures of these regions (the Middle East, India, China and Japan) as preparation for living and working abroad. <br/>The reflexive and constructivist perspective that provides the thread of Going East will reveal the dangers of an uncritical look at non-Western societies and the trap of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes important to avoid when trying to understand other societies, cultures and subcultures.<br/><br/>Going East 1 is an introductory class to a masters project (3 credits). It will be taught alternately in French and in English. It is open to and recommended for anyone interested in a dialogue with \u00abother\u00bb cultures. At the end of the semester, students have two options: <br/><br/>a) Enrol in \u00abGoing East 2\u00bb in spring 2012 and complete the missing 3 credits by writing a research project in agreement supervisors in CACS.<br/><br/>b) Enrol in the \u00abMinor in Area and Cultural Studies\u00bb (http://cdh.epfl.ch/cas). The minor will start in spring 2012 and finish December 2012. Lausanne and Bangalore/Shanghai summer schools are its central programmes. The remaining 3 credits (along the classic lines of the CDH Master Programme) may be obtained via language courses in parallel to the minor, starting in spring 2012 (Mandarin, Hindi or Arabic).<br/><br/>",

The search for the building materials: stone, brick, wood. The transport of the materials: over land, on the rivers, by sea; on sledge, cart and barge. The men on the building sites: their training, their tools, their skills. The erecting of the building: ramps, scaffolding and machines.

The architectures will be studied in such a way to encourage the students to question the reasons of building them in a definite time and place, the objective of the customer, the builder and the architect, the influence of the architect's conceptions had on the realisations of the architectures, why the spaces and structures have been conceived that way, why the functions have been distributed that way, how and why the various materials and techniques have been chosen, what are the connection between an architecture and its physical location, how it is influenced by the conditions it is viewed, what are its connections with architectures of the past or of the same period with similar functions, etc. These various questions should make the students able to consider the interconnections between several aspects.<br/><br/><br/>",

   "content": "The basic concept of intertextuality questions the traceability of ideas, themes and forms in architecture and considers the \"sources\" or \"influences\" not only as granted but also as agents of a creative work. With the intertextual approach, a particular role is given to \"genetic\" analysis - and critics -, hence to the study of the projecting choices which are gradually made according to external stimuli or influences and, above all, for reasons of internal coherence. These choices are very important to define the meaning of the work.<br/><br/>Based on the indications found in architectural criticism and historiography, from the second half of the 20th century onwards, we will introduce concepts that have had a decisive and somewhat subliminal on the projecting practice of the 20th century. These concepts are mainly: 'Raumgestaltung' (or space design), that architects and historians have sometimes considered as the very essence of architecture; architectonic as the expressive dimension (demonstrated or not) of the \"raw\" technical constructional element, of the \"functionality\" as an expressive dimension (expressed or denied) of the objective elements of the interface between use and work. We will then try to identify the \"figures\" that result in the representation conveyed by the above mentioned concepts and to analyze them as \"stylistic features\".<br/>",

They do so following both complex and often cryptic patterns. Within the process of creating both standardized and automatic flows and treatment of information, Internet so increases the individuals' capacities of exchange, of organisation, of production - in spite of the topographic distances that may separate them. Launched five decades ago, such a process has extended its magnitude during the last ten years, to the extent of disrupting the various elements structuring our \"being together\" - such as norms, ethics, practices and governance - underlining the fragility relative to the latter's only temporarily stable, and so often debated, legitimacy.<br/><br/>A full appreciation of the corresponding stakes requires an appropriate and renewed understanding of social facts at large (reorganisation of the various forms of intermediation, increased exposure of one's personal life, frailty of the digital identity, reconsideration of immaterial goods' market value). Seldom has it been so important to think simultaneously territories and networks, individuals and groups, humans and non-humans, technology and its applications, hardware and software, the tangible and virtual realities.<br/><br/> Students are to write an essay dealing thematically and illustrating effectively one of the following issues:<br/> - Space: spatial action, spatiality (distance as an obstacle to social interaction)<br/> - Internet: technology, norms, network, space, place (interspatiality, global and local scale)<br/> - Individual being: privacy, trust, identity, the body (digital trail, avatar)<br/> - Group: new intermediation process (hierarchy, collective intelligence)<br/> - Society: ethics, norms and governance (copyright, conflict of interests).",

We will review protoplanetary disk formation and planetesimal accretion processes. We will take a brief tour of the solar system in its current state: planets, satellites, planetesimals (e.g. comets).<br/><b>The Sun</b><br/>The Sun affects all the processes in our solar system and is the ultimate source of energy for life on our planet. The solar interior, the magnetic field, the solar atmosphere, and the solar wind plasma will be discussed in detail. Transient events such coronal mass ejections and solar flares will be presented.<br/><b>Space Plasma Physics</b><br/>Interplanetary space is filled with a sparse plasma. Basic plasma phenomena will be discussed, e.g. plasma motion, boundaries, shock acceleration, and energetic particle populations.<br/><b>Earth and Planetary Magnetospheres</b><br/>Many planets possess an intrinsic magnetic dipole.

Although mathematical in nature, this set up allows for an intuitive geometrical understanding that we will instist upon throughout the course.<br/><b>1. From Euclid to Hilbert :</b><br/>- Vector spaces, Hilbert spaces, approximation.<br/>- Orthogonal and oblique projections, projection as least squares estimation.<br/>- Decompositions, bases, frames, computational aspects.<br/>- Random vectors.<br/><b><i>Part II : Modeling and Analysis</b></i><br/>In this part, we provide the signals from a Hilbert space with an order using the concept of time. We present basic concepts of discrete-time and continuous-time signal processing with a twist. Through the lens of geometry, we introduce multirate systems as operators and the Fourier transform, in both the discrete-and continuous-time set up, as an expansion into a basis of complex exponentials.We also present the basics of stochastic signal processing.<br/><b>2. Sequences and Discrete-Time Systems :</b><br/>- Sequences, systems, discrete-time Fourier transform, z-transform, discrete Fourier transform.<br/>- Multirate sequences and systems, computational aspects.<br/>- Discrete-time stochastic processing, power spectrum.<br/><b>3.Functions and Continuous-Time Systems :</b><br/>- Functions, linear time-invariant systems, partial differential equations.<br/>- Fourier transform and series : existence, inverse and properties.<br/>- Continuous-time stochastic processing and power spectrum.<br/><b><i>Part III : Measuring and Processing</b></i><br/>In this part,we learn how to go from the continuous world to the discrete one and back through sampling and interpolation. We stray from the traditional signal processing path by presenting sampling operators as orthogonal expansions. Here, the concept of approximation naturally<br/><br/>arises since sampling followed by interpolation leads in general to imperfect reconstruction.<br/><b>4. Sampling, Interpolation and Approximation :</b><br/>- Sampling expansions and sampling theorems as an orthogonal expansion.<br/>- Interpolation, spline and shift-invariant subspaces.<br/>- Approximation on finite intervals by polynomials.<br/>- Linear and non-linear approximation.<br/>- Approximation of stochastic processes and the Karhunen-Loeve transform.<br/><b><i>Part IV : Applications</b></i><br/>This part uses the tools introduced above to present modern applications of signal processing such as MP3 encoding, image compression, stock market prediction and biomedical signal processing.<br/><b>5. Applications</b><br/>- Signal processing for audio and acoustics with application to audio coding.<br/>- Time-frequency analysis and wavelet signal processing with application to image compression.<br/>- Statistical signal processing with application to stock market prediction.<br/>- Mathematical principles of signal processing with application to neurobiology.<br/><b>6.

   "learning_outcomes": "The goal of this class is to present signal processing tools from the point of view of geometry, which facilitates an intuitive understanding of the material. The geometric view is at the heart of all modern signal processing representations like the short time Fourier transform, time-frequency analysis and wavelets. The course is designed to provide the depth and rigor needed for the study of advanced topics in signal processing, as well as current applications where these tools are crucial. In particular, several applications will be studied, including : image compression with linear and non-linear approximation, prediction of the stock market, Wi-Fi communication, learning, and breast cancer detection. In the last part of the course, advanced topics in signal processing will be presented. These are : Acoustics and audio signal processing with application to audio coding, time-frequency analysis and wavelets with application to image compression, statistical signal processing with financial prediction and mathematical principles of signal processing with application to neurobiology.<br/>At the end of this course, students will be able to :<br/>- Master the right tools to tackle advanced signal and data processing problems<br/>- Have an intuitive understanding of signal processing through a geometrical approach<br/>- Get to know the applications that are of interest today<br/>- Learn about topics that are forefront of signal processing research<br/>... and learn everything you always wanted to know about signal processing but were afraid to ask.<br/>Thie course is based on \"Foundations of Signals and Systems\", which is Part I on the book \"Fourier and wavelet signal processing\" by M.

The free, forced and harmonic motion of a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator is analysed and the corresponding complex, operational and time admittance, as well as the complex response function, are extracted from the system. The two-degree-of-freedom oscillator is then studied and the coupling between the two degrees of freedom is carefully investigated. The study is generalised to the analysis of the multi-degree-of-freedom oscillator under conservative or dissipative (proportional and general viscous damping), free or forced, motion. In a second part, the course is oriented towards the vibratory behaviour of second-order continuous systems like cables under transverse vibrations, bars under longitudinal vibrations or shafts under torsional vibrations. The analysis is then extended to fourth-order continuous systems such as beams subjected to bending vibrations. Finally, the course gives a brief overview of the elementary non-linear oscillator by investigating the different sources of non-linearity, by describing the free and forced motion of the non-linear system and by discussing some solution methods of time and frequency integration.",

Most of these tools are borrowed from other fields, surch as random graph theory, statistical physics, nonlinear dynammical systems, random algorithms, developmental biology and game theory.<br/>This course will bring together elements of these theories and their application to \"large-scale, self-organized or uncontrolled\" networks. It will provide an introduction to and perspective on this emerging field, and an opportunity to track and discuss new developments. The course will balance mathematical rigor with practical lessons for engineering.",

An important section of the course is dedicated to brain disorders and their repair with special emphasis on neuroprosthetics. Students will be exposed to the basic methods on how to study the brain in vivo and in vitro, in animals and humans, including cellular electrophysiology, optical imaging, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and computational neuroscience. This will enable the student to critically evaluate how neurons, groups of neurons, and brain regions are studied and how they contribute to sensory, motor, and cognitive functions.

This will enable the student to critically evaluate how neurons are studied. The second goal is to learn how synaptic input is integrated and processed in single neurons based on the active and passive properties of axons and dendrites. Students will assemble their knowledge of synapses and neurons into a coherent picture of neuronal network function, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic, inhibitory GABAergic neurons, plasticity and neuromodulation.

   "content": "Optimization is not only a major segment of applied mathematics, it is also a critical problem in many economic and engineering sectors. In any situation where resources are limited, decision makers try to solve problems they face in the \"best possible\" manner. Obviously, optimality depends on the objectives which are targeted! The course \"optimal decision analysis\" will provide theory and practical tools to solve optimization problems, for a broad number of problems, from linear to non-linear optimization, form unconstrained to constrained optimization and will include general issues such as robustness and sensitivity analysis.<br/><br/>Though optimization has been a topic in mathematics for centuries, recent (less than 30 year-old) methods have been devised to solve a very broad range of problems, encompassing many of the questions mentioned before. These are convex optimization problems. The course will show the power and \"simplicity\" of such problems, in particular through the generic group of interior-point methods.<br/><br/>The course goes deeply into applied mathematics through the use of theory and also in practice thanks to software tools. MATLAB is a very generic software tool for numerical simulation that will be used in the course. A decent background in linear algebra will be very useful for the courses.",

The theoretical bases of each method, including specific aspects such as parallelization and visualization, are presented in introductory lectures.

   "learning_outcomes": "\u2022  Modern physiology aims at understanding the function of the different systems in the human body, from a molecular, cellular and an integrative perspective in tissues and organs. Such integrated approach leads to the fundamentals of what is called today system biology. A global understanding of organ functions presented by systems is indeed critical for developing new studies or diagnostic methods as well as pharmacological and gene-oriented therapies for the cure of human diseases.<br/>\u2022  Students will learn basic principles that lead to appreciate the main physiological functions of our body including the regulatory functions of each system mentioned bellow, which are central in its homeostasis. Each system will be also approached with the essential notions of anatomy and histology and pharmacology together with the experimental methods used in the respective fields.<br/>\u2022  Students will be asked to develop their capacity to learn through a problem solving approach and complete their training by personal readings in the reference textbook<br/>",

Then, projects are done by groups of 3-5 students. Each group chooses a subject and works on it under the mentoring of a professor or an experienced EPFL collaborator. Students address both scientific and non scientific issues related to the project. Non technical issues include the marketing of new products or devices, the intellectual property, the respect of national and international regulations,... Bench work is usually not part of such projects.<br/><br/><br/><b>Projects in Biosciences</b><br/>These projects can take many different forms, depending on the selected subject. Some projects include bench work, some do not. Projects with little or no bench work are more oriented toward data analysis. <br/>Projects can be done in any area related to life sciences (including signal analysis, Imaging, biostatistics, bioinformatics,... provided students find a supervisor willing to take the responability for the project.<br/>Interested students themselves find a supervisor with whom they define both the project content and the modalities of the final evalualtion.

Most of the theoretical concepts introduced will be put in practice using a PC with dedicated software (e.g., Matlab or C code, simulators), a small mobile desktop robot  developed at EPFL for educational purposes (e-puck), and, when appropriate, a wireless embedded system endowed with sensors (Mica-z). Using the same tools, a small project allows teams of students to apply the knowledge acquired in the course to a concrete case study. <br/><br/><br/>",

   "learning_outcomes": "This course teaches students how to develop software in the real world, work in large teams, be productive with code bases that cannot be comprehended in their entirety, and interact with real customers. Planning a feature, estimating total cost, packaging it up for distribution and maintenance are things that inexperienced developers rarely get right, but are vital for the success of a software project. Mediating between the needs of customers and the turn-coffee-into-code hacker attitude requires understanding both sides of the equation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In this course (SDP), we pretend we are a start-up and continue to develop the EPFL Pocket Campus, a highly successful smartphone application that helps EPFL members locate their friends on campus, spot and rate the best lunch menus, manage courses, navigate on campus, etc. This coming semester we will substantially expand Pocket Campus with new components like augmented reality and Camipro cash payments.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>An important prerequisite for SDP is the Software Engineering course: it must either be taken in parallel with SDP or have been taken in the past. The two courses are designed to be taken together.<br/><br/>SDP is a hard course and requires a significant time investment; the amount of work may exceed the number of credits, depending on the student's experience and ability to learn quickly and adjust to the realities of real-world software development. The rewards of this effort, however, are truly unique. Last year, after SDP was over, half the students taking it chose to continue working on Pocket Campus as part of their semester projects; this culminated in a public release of EPFL Pocket Campus on the Android app market.",

This at first a-gravitational reality will then be confronted with our bodily existence. Consequently light will be introduced as a mediator between conceptual abstraction and physical existence.<br/><br/>A series of drawing-projects include an analysis of the functioning of the visual apparatus in living species, analytical methods of description of form and space: plan, section, axons, perspective and lead towards a first series of shop drawings for the fabrication of moulds for the respective projects. <br/><br/>The second half of the semester will be devoted to a first architectural project to be developed in a sequence of didactic steps. Fabrication of models and mock-ups will bring in the body and bodily perception and production into the process of developing architectonic thinking. This approach will be paralleled by the introduction of digital tools in the design process. 3d-software is implemented to understand drawing as 3d-space projected into the 2d-drafting-plane as analytical base for tectonic thinking: the process of drawing as a means to think space. <br/>",

Rather it projects the envisioned into the future (time) and into space.

How can we explore our environment, synthesize sensorial perceptions and make sense of visual cues? How can we address gravitational and conceptual realities, relate space toward our body and thus scale the world against ourselves?<br/><br/>Such explorations must be based on a consciousness of our living environment as a source and resource of life. Our actions will have to be based on an understanding of ourselves as being part of cyclic flows and transitions, where both built and natural environments can be understood as mutual resources.<br/><br/>",

How can we create environments, in which life-quality becomes a primary criterion for the creation and management of space? How can we densify cities and potentially redefine zones of structured nature? How can we create places of identity, find a balance between production and leisure, between activity and rest by using contrast and dynamic equilibrium as potentialities to store identity as latent energy: between the vertical and the horizontal, between the built and the unbuilt?<br/><br/>The program of semester 2 is designed to challenge our notions of the natural and the artificial to foster a planet-conscious approach for the design of our living environments.<br/>",

The studio will be organized around a series of cumulative exercises and workshops. We will unpack historical as well as contemporary precedents while expanding on the tools and techniques of architectural thinking with individual projects. More specifically we will use large-scale models and prototyping, in parallel with digital tools, to understand the translation of concept to form.  Photography and collage will be used to further exploit the physical modeling and to understand models as tools as well as artifacts.<br/><br/>Using the two semesters as complementary and dialectical halves of the year, we will focus on site and then on program as catalysts of concept, form, and organization to underscore their complicit effects in design.  The first semester takes on multiple sites in deep nature to construct the architectural narrative of space and sequence while the second will focus on urban building typologies to question established interpretations of program and organization.  The two semesters, raw nature and dense urbanity, will therefore also serve as a mirror to contemporary Swiss geography where the proximity of landscape and urbanism may redefine the role of architecture.<br/><br/>", 
   "semester": "Spring", 
   "learning_outcomes": "Architecture is a speculative discipline. The creative act demands not only an understanding of the tools and techniques of design but above all a process of critique that sees problems and constraints as opportunities.<br/><br/>In this vein, the studio will take as its premise architecture as a construct. It is on the one hand a very literal material and technological construction: a system of parts to whole that negotiates between the figural object of the building and its organizational configurations. On the other hand, architecture is also the construction of a process, a methodology or a set of techniques that guides decision-making within the search for new relationships. We will address both of these ideas of construct. But above all, we are interested in a third kind of construct, and that is the conceptual construct - the fiction or the narrative - that we create in the positioning of our work, and without which design would simply be problem solving. <br/>",

This twofold approach enables issues of conceptual, spatial and expressive cohesion to be dealt with, while at the same time exploring ways and means of turning the challenges of sustainability into a raw material for architects.<br/><br/>The particular aim is to study interactions between issues of density, mixed land use and quality of life, design buildings which take on board the principles of bioclimatic architecture and develop construction details in a manner which is consistent with fundamental notions of sustainability. <br/><br/>The project exercises are based on the search for creative solutions appropriate to the development of a dense and mixed urban site.

In fact, urban sprawl not only requires the use of large amounts of land but also generates important environmental impacts, accompanied by socio-cultural disparities and higher costs.<br/><br/>In this context, the architectural project is destined to play a central role in the search for alternatives, enabling urban development to be re-focused towards the town areas, the density of construction within easy access of public transport services increased and sustainable building techniques generated. By adopting an approach involving different scales of intervention - ranging from an urban project to the constructive details of buildings - the studio will seek to analyse, explore and experiment with the challenges inherent in this search for an architectural contribution to the sustainable city.<br/>",

Each semester a new site will be selected within this densifying area for an independent project assessment. Projects will have to integrate the mixed-use dimension and the transformation of the site's current status - mainly industrial areas - into an area dedicated to housing/offices/equipment.

These \"blossoming\" sites are part of an \"imaginary\" metropolis whose growth is mapped through a series of hypotheses.<br/><br/>We have chosen an area undergoing profound changes, whose centre of gravity is defined by the empty space left by Lake Geneva. This \"natural\" void is circumscribed by a built environment whose varying degrees of density make up a polycentric metropolis able to host great functional diversity. We aim to draw up a picture of this metropolis through interventions in several of its urban centres.<br/><br/>The learning objectives aim at devising architectural projects in this context of ongoing urban or suburban development. We shall also reflect on the search for collective values (public areas, mixed-use, density) in urban areas. Students will learn to adopt a town planning and architectural attitude in the face of the metropolis development issue. <br/>",

   "content": "The protection project calls for a number of rational and technical investigations which will at once yield knowledge of the object of the study and define the uses of potential work to be carried out. The documentation of the building will be compiled with the help of historical research and graphic and photographic records, of its construction process and its material character, and of its sensitive and sensual aspects. The heritage value of the building will be determined by placing it in its historical, architectural and urban context, in the work of the actors that designed and built it, as well as in terms of its role as an economic and social resource. An analysis of its functional and distribution capacities, of its constitution and physical characteristics will dictate its potentials in terms of utilisation, maintenance and restructuring.<br/><br/>The protection project is a dual and inseparable project of conservation and renovation: the material substance of an existing building is conserved, preserved, reinforced, set off to advantage or returned to its original function, while at the same time something new is grafted onto this building to produce a prolongation of its life-cycle, a superimposition and juxtaposition of added elements. The project also concerns the reinforcement of a metal frame as well as the addition of a new functional body, and it focuses on the awareness of the relations and interfaces produced by their significance.<br/><br/>The workshop thus aims to familiarise students with the theoretical and practical elements of the development of the discipline of this project: of this \"knowledge in action\".<br/><br/>The object - and indeed the entirety - of this study and the subject of the project is linked to our daily heritage: that of the towns and countryside of post-war French-speaking Switzerland.",

The protection project and the project to be pursued in existing structures are part of a composite cultural discipline that extends the borders of contemporary architecture. Building in built structures is not a new practice, far from it. What turns it into a contemporary attitude, however, is the kind of theoretical and practical questioning about the architectural object at all its scales, as well as a closer look at the material character of the building, which both give rise to the project.<br/>",

   "learning_outcomes": "This workshop has a twofold purpose: on the one hand, the development of a social housing project that is conceived as an urban construction project, and on the other hand, a critical consideration of the implications that such a project gives rise to. The point is to expand on and advance the discourses which modern architecture has developed in this field and to explore the way in which these theories have produced a genuine impact on the city. Inside the constellation of the Modern Movement, a number of experiments have given a precise connotation to the cities in which they have been realised, thus contributing to the definition of the character of those cities. Continued theoretical commitment will be required as it is an indispensable instrument for both the construction of the project and the definition of a general point of view regarding the housing issue.<br/>",

   "learning_outcomes": "This course aims to demonstrate that the properties of advanced polymer materials depends on both their molecular structure, i.e., constitution and configuration, and their interamolceular as well as intermolecular non-convalent interactions. The former control the conformation of a polymer chain (i.e., its overall shape and shape persistence), while the latter determine the aggregation and microphase segregation of polymers. Consequently, these non-covalent interactions give rise to hierarchical structure formation and exert an important influence on the material properties. In analogy to modern organic chemistry and biochemistry, the preparation of advanced polymers tries to take these aspects into account. The building blocks used in modern polymer synthesis often attempt to encode the supramolecular behavior into the molecular structure. The course aims to provide an understanding of the underlying principles, discuss the consequences and give illustrative examples of modern applications, such as organic optoelectronic materials, shape-memory polymers, or self-assembled nanoscopic objects.<br/><br/>",
